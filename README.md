# SchrodingerLanczos
Program implementing the Lanczos Algorithm to solve the Schrodinger Equation in two Dimensions. 3 example programs are given to solve a square well potential, dot potential, and point charges potential. To change potential, change values in the potential function. To change the charge of the particle, change the value of the variable charge. To change the number of implementations of Lanczos algorithm, edit iterations variable.
